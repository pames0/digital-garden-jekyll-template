One of my foundational bits of family folklore surrounds my grandmother's funeral. I didn't attend; I was 8yo and lived a two day drive away. She was 55, and her mother-in-law was well past 80. The folklore is that my great-grandmother said that it should have been her.

This has followed me around, worming its way into my life, including when I lost my partner who was just shy of 50. I mentally categorized people into more supportive than my dead partner (which, to be fair, was a high bar given our relationship), less supportive than my dead partner, and would prefer that it had been me instead. There are many ways to navigate grief, and it seems like "deciding everyone I used to know proactively wants me to die" is on the unhealthy end of the spectrum. Nobody needs that baggage.

My sibling's parent in law is experiencing significant health concerns, which means I get to regularly hear people talk about when this living human who is a part of my sibling's family is going to die, with more than a hint of eager anticipation. This is weird. Nobody should be doing that. But often the SPIL's age come up as a concern. The SPIL is younger than my folks by a decade, and it almost feels like my folks believe everyone has a fixed lifespan which is universal.

Our time comes when it comes, and we can celebrate the moments that we have. My grandmother's time was when she was called, as was my partner's.
