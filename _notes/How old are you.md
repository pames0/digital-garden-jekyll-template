Reading a book by a biologist/anthropologist/palentologist (since I'm only halfway through, I half-expect another field or two will be revealed in due time), the author reported a dialog with someone from a traditional culture that went something like:
- How old are you?
- blank stare
- How old are you (enunciating more clearly)
- You tell me

Since the group doesn't track ages, the anthropologists are left with other tools (life events, more or less) to work out how old people are.

How old would I be if I didn't know how old I was? It feels like since puberty, major milestones come a decade or two early or late, almost never when they should. 

- Lose hearing - 45-47
- Cataracts - 38-42
- Become a widow - 45
- First grey hair - maybe 50s?
- Stop being carded for alcohol - 38
- Midlife crisis - Ah, this one is right! 39
